  "lesson_description": "In this lesson, students connect an arithmetic sequence in explicit form to a linear function in slope-intercept form. They prove that the common difference and the slope are always constant and equal. Students use first differences to determine whether a table represents a linear relationship and learn about average rate of change. They create a table of values and determine whether the sequences have the same slope between any two points.",

    "I can relate the defining characteristics of an arithmetic sequence, the first term and common difference, and the defining characteristics of a linear function, the y-intercept and slope.",
    "I can use algebraic properties to prove that the explicit formula for an arithmetic sequence is equivalent to the equation of a linear function.",
    "I can connect the slope of a line to the average rate of change of a function."
